You can view the underlying source code and download raw data from this Github repository.\nCurrently, we identify 48,956 rental properties containing 157,292 housing units. We identify 21,555 total ownership networks of which 15,603 (72%) own just a single property. Of those networks which own multiple properties, 3,373 include multiple distinct owner names.\n\nnetworks by size\nMost landlord networks are small. In fact, 72% of networks own just a single parcel. Another 18% own 2 or 3 parcels. Together, these two categories own 50% of all the rental parcels in the city. Collectively, ownership networks with at least 26 parcels own 20% of rental parcels, despite constituting just 0.6% of owner networks.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile most rental parcels are owned by smaller owner networks, most rental units are owned by larger networks, as shown in the graph below.\nOnly 3.2% of networks own more than 25 units, but these networks collectively own 59% of the cityâ€™s rental inventory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlargest networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Top 15 largest ownership networks, by total units\n    \n    \n      City of Milwaukee\n    \n    \n      owner network1\n      names in network\n      units\n      parcels\n      assessed value\n      \n        annual rates per 100 units\n      \n    \n    \n      eviction filings\n      code violations\n    \n  \n  \n    BERRADA PROPERTIES 106 LLC Group\n122\n9,187\n870\n$409.6M\n32.0\n17.4\n    1126 KANE LLC Group\n108\n3,712\n180\n$301.2M\n3.6\n3.3\n    CITY OF MILWAUKEE Group\n19\n2,676\n882\n$12.5M\n2.2\n2.6\n    METROPOLITAN ASSOCIATES FKA Group\n10\n2,299\n24\n$144.4M\n8.0\n1.7\n    TCR MRC PHASE I LTD PTNRSHP Group\n16\n2,176\n20\n$338.8M\n0.4\n0.3\n    WI ARBOR RIDGE ON 107TH LLC Group\n8\n1,622\n14\n$243.8M\n2.4\n0.9\n    STEWART G FRIEND Group\n45\n1,542\n91\n$87.0M\n2.3\n6.1\n    MLK INVESTMENT GROUP LLC Group\n21\n1,196\n37\n$164.1M\n0.9\n8.4\n    HIGGINS INVESTMENTS LLC Group\n30\n1,139\n49\n$81.5M\n0.6\n3.0\n    WELLSTON APARTMENTS LLC Group\n18\n1,009\n24\n$106.8M\n0.4\n1.9\n    ECT 64 LLC ET AL Group\n25\n994\n25\n$81.6M\n0.4\n3.1\n    ICRC HOUSING PROJECT NO 2 Group\n28\n830\n66\n$58.5M\n3.0\n5.7\n    TE I LLC Group\n20\n807\n328\n$46.7M\n36.4\n25.0\n    NORTHSIDE HOMEOWNERS Group\n21\n801\n320\n$29.7M\n29.8\n7.9\n    VB ONE LLC Group\n13\n783\n753\n$80.1M\n22.0\n33.7\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      1 Owner networks are given the name of the most frequently used individual owner name in the network.
