    "text": "Census data also measures housing units and tenure, providing a useful external check on our measurements.\nThe 2020 decennial census counted 257,700 total housing units in the city, of which 92,900 were owner-occupied and 154,500 were rented or listed for rent. (The remainder were unoccupied, but not for rent).\nThe 2022 1-year American Community Survey (ACS) estimated a total of 261,200 housing units with a margin of error of about 3,800. Of those, the ACS estimated that 96,000 were owner-occupied (MOE of 4,300) and 147,600 were rentals (MOE of 4,800).\nWe measure the owner-occupation of a parcel by comparing the address to which the property taxes are mailed with the situs address(es) of the property. If they match and the property is coded as a non-apartment building, we consider it owner-occupied. Our measure closely matches census estimates of total owner-occupied housing units, as the graph below shoes.\n\nWe identify residential housing units using the city assessor’s residential housing units field and removing parcels which are owner occupied. This means we consider duplexes owner-occupied when the owner lives at the property, regardless of whether or not they rent out their additional unit. This situation also affects a small number of owner-occupied triplexes and quadplexes.\nFor these reasons, we expect our count of rental units to slightly undercount rental units relative to the true total. Currently, we count 143,337 rental units, compared to 154,500 in the 2020 census count and 147,600 in the 2022 ACS estimate. Considering the different methods for generating these statistics, we are satisfied with this general agreement across data sources."

    "text": "This website contains eviction statistics drawn from a dataset which matches court records with parcel records. We succesfully match more than 98% of eviction records to a parcel. Our records currently cover 2016-01-01 to 2024-12-27.\n\neviction rate calculations\nHere is how we calculate eviction rates for each ownership network.\n\nFor each property, we count the number of days during which the current owner held the property and eviction records are available. We determine when the period of current ownership began using the CONVEY_DATE variable provided by the city assessor.\nWe divide the days of ownership (during the eviction-covered period) by 365.25, then multiply by the number of housing units at the property. The product is the number of housing-unit-years.\nWe add up all the housing-unit-years for each property in the network to calculate the network’s total housing-unit-years.\nWe assign evictions to a property’s current owner if the eviction was filed after the current owner bought the property, judging by the CONVEY_DATE field.\nFor each owner network, we count the total number of eviction filings (and orders) and divide by the total number of housing-unit-years. Then, we multiply the quotient by 100. The result is the network’s annual rate of eviction filings (or orders) per 100 units.\n\n\n\ncitywide rates\nFor reference, here are citywide eviction rates.\nTo calculate these, we divide the total number of (matched) evictions occuring at residential properties by the total number of rental units. Because this includes vacant rental units, our method results in slightly lower eviction rates than if we divided by the number of renting households.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnual eviction totals in the City of Milwaukee\n\n\n\n\nat residential properties\n\nrental units1\n\nper 100 units\n\n\n\nfilings\norders\nfilings\norders\n\n\n\n\n2016\n10,857\n5,402\n145,371\n7.5\n3.7\n\n\n2017\n11,607\n5,325\n146,548\n7.9\n3.6\n\n\n2018\n11,414\n5,054\n148,023\n7.7\n3.4\n\n\n2019\n11,369\n4,921\n149,027\n7.6\n3.3\n\n\n2 2020\n7,513\n2,496\n148,720\n5.1\n1.7\n\n\n2 2021\n6,711\n2,746\n147,730\n4.5\n1.9\n\n\n2022\n11,665\n4,680\n147,403\n7.9\n3.2\n\n\n2023\n11,506\n4,596\n147,186\n7.8\n3.1\n\n\n2024\n8,176\n2,572\n147,285\n5.6\n1.7\n\n\n\n1 Calculated from city parcel records.\n\n\n2 Various pandemic-era policy interventions, including moratoriums, reduced evictions during these years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nby aldermanic district\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEviction filing and order rates by Milwaukee aldermanic district\n\n\n\n\n2016\n\n\n2017\n\n\n2018\n\n\n2019\n\n\n20201\n\n\n20211\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2023\n\n\n2024\n\n\n\nfilings\norders\nfilings\norders\nfilings\norders\nfilings\norders\nfilings\norders\nfilings\norders\nfilings\norders\nfilings\norders\nfilings\norders\n\n\n\n\nfirst\n14.4\n7.4\n14.9\n7.2\n15.2\n6.7\n15.6\n7.1\n10.2\n3.6\n8.0\n3.4\n15.2\n6.0\n15.1\n6.1\n10.0\n3.0\n\n\nsecond\n15.7\n7.6\n17.3\n7.2\n18.0\n7.6\n18.6\n7.4\n10.9\n2.8\n8.0\n2.9\n19.1\n6.9\n20.6\n7.7\n14.1\n4.3\n\n\nthird\n1.3\n0.6\n1.1\n0.5\n1.1\n0.4\n1.3\n0.5\n0.8\n0.3\n0.8\n0.3\n1.6\n0.7\n1.5\n0.7\n1.2\n0.5\n\n\nfourth\n4.3\n2.3\n4.8\n2.3\n5.4\n2.4\n5.1\n2.1\n2.7\n0.9\n2.9\n1.5\n4.4\n2.1\n4.4\n2.0\n2.7\n1.1\n\n\nfifth\n9.2\n4.0\n9.5\n3.5\n9.3\n3.8\n9.0\n3.2\n5.9\n1.2\n4.6\n1.5\n10.0\n3.7\n10.7\n3.6\n8.6\n2.4\n\n\nsixth\n9.6\n4.7\n10.3\n4.9\n9.5\n4.4\n10.2\n4.5\n6.9\n2.6\n6.4\n2.8\n8.9\n3.3\n8.1\n3.3\n6.4\n2.0\n\n\nseventh\n12.5\n6.2\n13.4\n6.3\n13.9\n5.8\n13.2\n5.7\n9.4\n3.0\n9.5\n3.3\n12.5\n4.8\n11.6\n4.5\n8.7\n2.6\n\n\neighth\n7.1\n3.6\n6.7\n3.3\n6.1\n3.0\n6.1\n2.9\n4.9\n1.8\n4.2\n1.9\n7.0\n3.3\n5.8\n2.6\n3.7\n1.3\n\n\nninth\n4.3\n2.0\n4.6\n1.9\n4.0\n1.6\n4.0\n1.7\n2.6\n0.8\n1.8\n0.8\n10.7\n4.2\n14.2\n4.9\n11.4\n3.2\n\n\ntenth\n6.4\n3.0\n7.3\n3.1\n6.7\n3.2\n6.5\n2.8\n4.2\n1.5\n3.4\n1.5\n7.8\n3.1\n8.1\n3.3\n5.4\n1.7\n\n\neleventh\n2.9\n1.4\n3.3\n1.3\n3.0\n1.3\n3.4\n1.6\n2.4\n0.7\n2.2\n0.8\n3.3\n1.3\n3.1\n1.0\n2.4\n0.7\n\n\ntwelfth\n7.3\n4.0\n7.8\n3.8\n6.2\n3.2\n5.6\n2.9\n4.2\n1.6\n4.4\n2.1\n6.1\n2.8\n5.3\n2.3\n3.6\n1.2\n\n\nthirteenth\n3.3\n1.4\n3.3\n1.4\n3.8\n1.7\n3.2\n1.6\n2.8\n0.9\n2.8\n1.0\n4.3\n1.7\n3.2\n1.3\n2.6\n0.8\n\n\nfourteenth\n3.4\n1.6\n2.9\n1.3\n2.6\n1.3\n2.3\n1.1\n1.7\n0.7\n1.7\n0.8\n2.7\n1.2\n2.1\n0.9\n1.5\n0.8\n\n\nfifteenth\n13.6\n7.1\n15.1\n7.4\n14.7\n6.3\n14.1\n5.8\n9.9\n3.4\n9.8\n3.5\n12.0\n5.0\n10.7\n4.5\n7.9\n2.6\n\n\n\n1 Various pandemic-era policy interventions, including moratoriums, reduced evictions during these years"

A code violation can cover a wide range of issues, from minor garbage violations to more serious structural issues. At this time our website simply shows the total number (and rate) of violations, so we encourage readers to use the DNS website to look up specific code violations for properties of interest.\nDNS inspectors are not allowed to enter properties to conduct random inspections. Instead, they usually conduct interior inspections after receiving tenant complaints.
