    "text": "This website contains eviction statistics drawn from a dataset which matches court records with parcel records. We succesfully match more than 98% of eviction records to a parcel. Our records currently cover Jan 01, 2016 to Jan 29, 2024.\n\neviction rate calculations\nHere is how we calculate eviction rates for each ownership network.\n\nFor each property, we count the number of days during which the current owner held the property and eviction records are available. We determine when the period of current ownership began using the CONVEY_DATE variable provided by the city assessor.\nWe divide the days of ownership (during the eviction-covered period) by 365.25, then multiply by the number of housing units at the property. The product is the number of housing-unit-years.\nWe add up all the housing-unit-years for each property in the network to calculate the network’s total housing-unit-years.\nWe assign evictions to a property’s current owner if the eviction was filed after the current owner bought the property, judging by the CONVEY_DATE field.\nFor each owner network, we count the total number of eviction filings (and orders) and divide by the total number of housing-unit-years. Then, we multiply the quotient by 100. The result is the network’s annual rate of eviction filings (or orders) per 100 units.\n\n\n\ncitywide rates\nFor reference, here are citywide eviction rates.\nTo calculate these, we divide the total number of (matched) evictions occuring at residential properties by the total number of rental units. Because this includes vacant rental units, our method results in slightly lower eviction rates than if we divided by the number of renting households.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnual eviction totals in the City of Milwaukee\n\n\n\nat residential properties\nrental units1\nper 100 units\n\n\nfilings\norders\nfilings\norders\n\n\n\n\n2016\n10,919\n5,436\n147,647\n7.4\n3.7\n\n\n2017\n11,662\n5,355\n148,735\n7.8\n3.6\n\n\n2018\n11,509\n5,092\n149,326\n7.7\n3.4\n\n\n2019\n11,437\n4,935\n156,709\n7.3\n3.1\n\n\n2 2020\n7,546\n2,502\n156,644\n4.8\n1.6\n\n\n2 2021\n6,738\n2,755\n156,068\n4.3\n1.8\n\n\n2022\n11,715\n4,697\n156,008\n7.5\n3.0\n\n\n2023\n11,532\n3,751\n156,297\n7.4\n2.4\n\n\n\n1 Calculated from city parcel records.\n\n\n2 Various pandemic-era policy interventions, including moratoriums, reduced evictions during these years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nby aldermanic district\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEviction filing and order rates by Milwaukee aldermanic district\n\n\n\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n20201\n20211\n2022\n2023\n\n\nfilings\norders\nfilings\norders\nfilings\norders\nfilings\norders\nfilings\norders\nfilings\norders\nfilings\norders\nfilings\norders\n\n\n\n\nfirst\n14.3\n7.4\n14.8\n7.1\n15.1\n6.7\n16.1\n7.3\n10.6\n3.7\n8.3\n3.6\n15.8\n6.2\n15.7\n5.2\n\n\nsecond\n15.7\n7.6\n17.3\n7.2\n18.0\n7.6\n18.4\n7.4\n10.8\n2.8\n7.9\n2.9\n18.7\n6.8\n20.4\n6.2\n\n\nthird\n1.3\n0.6\n1.1\n0.5\n1.1\n0.4\n1.3\n0.5\n0.8\n0.3\n0.8\n0.3\n1.6\n0.7\n1.5\n0.6\n\n\nfourth\n4.3\n2.2\n4.8\n2.4\n5.5\n2.5\n4.6\n1.9\n2.5\n0.8\n2.7\n1.3\n4.0\n1.9\n3.9\n1.5\n\n\nfifth\n9.2\n4.0\n9.5\n3.5\n9.3\n3.8\n8.8\n3.1\n5.7\n1.2\n4.5\n1.5\n9.7\n3.6\n10.4\n2.8\n\n\nsixth\n9.0\n4.4\n9.6\n4.6\n9.0\n4.2\n9.7\n4.3\n6.6\n2.5\n6.1\n2.7\n8.6\n3.2\n7.8\n2.5\n\n\nseventh\n11.8\n5.8\n12.6\n5.9\n13.1\n5.5\n12.3\n5.2\n8.7\n2.8\n8.8\n3.1\n11.6\n4.4\n10.8\n3.5\n\n\neighth\n7.0\n3.6\n6.6\n3.3\n6.0\n2.9\n5.7\n2.7\n4.5\n1.6\n3.9\n1.8\n6.5\n3.1\n5.4\n1.9\n\n\nninth\n4.2\n2.0\n4.5\n1.9\n3.8\n1.6\n3.7\n1.6\n2.4\n0.7\n1.6\n0.7\n9.7\n3.8\n12.9\n3.7\n\n\ntenth\n6.4\n3.0\n7.2\n3.0\n6.6\n3.1\n6.2\n2.7\n4.0\n1.4\n3.2\n1.4\n7.3\n2.9\n7.6\n2.6\n\n\neleventh\n2.8\n1.4\n3.2\n1.3\n3.0\n1.3\n3.3\n1.5\n2.3\n0.7\n2.1\n0.8\n3.2\n1.3\n2.9\n0.9\n\n\ntwelfth\n7.3\n4.0\n7.8\n3.8\n6.4\n3.3\n5.1\n2.6\n3.7\n1.4\n4.0\n1.9\n5.4\n2.5\n4.7\n1.7\n\n\nthirteenth\n3.3\n1.4\n3.2\n1.4\n3.8\n1.7\n2.9\n1.4\n2.5\n0.8\n2.5\n0.9\n3.9\n1.5\n2.8\n0.8\n\n\nfourteenth\n3.4\n1.6\n2.9\n1.3\n2.6\n1.3\n2.2\n1.1\n1.6\n0.6\n1.6\n0.7\n2.5\n1.1\n2.0\n0.7\n\n\nfifteenth\n13.2\n6.9\n14.6\n7.1\n14.3\n6.1\n13.1\n5.5\n9.3\n3.2\n9.3\n3.3\n11.5\n4.7\n10.1\n3.3\n\n\n\n1 Various pandemic-era policy interventions, including moratoriums, reduced evictions during these years"

A code violation can cover a wide range of issues, from minor garbage violations to more serious structural issues. At this time our website simply shows the total number (and rate) of violations, so we encourage readers to use the DNS website to look up specific code violations for properties of interest.\nDNS inspectors are not allowed to enter properties to conduct random inspections. Instead, they usually conduct interior inspections after receiving tenant complaints. Eviction orders correspond to a single visit, and each order can (and often does) include multiple violations requiring specific abatement.\nOur records currently cover Jan 01, 2017 to Dec 31, 2023.\n\ncode violation rate calculations\nHere is how we calculate code enforcement rates for each ownership network.\n\nFor each property, we count the number of days during which the current owner held the property and DNS records are available.
