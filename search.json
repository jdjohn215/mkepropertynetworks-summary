You can view the underlying source code and download raw data from this Github repository.\nCurrently, we identify 48,714 rental properties containing 148,177 housing units. We identify 20,933 total ownership networks of which 15,010 (72%) own just a single property. Of those networks which own multiple properties, 3,782 include multiple distinct owner names.\n\nnetworks by size\nMost landlord networks are small. In fact, 72% of networks own just a single parcel. Another 18% own 2 or 3 parcels. Together, these two categories own 49% of all the rental parcels in the city. Collectively, ownership networks with at least 26 parcels own 21% of rental parcels, despite constituting just 0.7% of owner networks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile most rental parcels are owned by smaller owner networks, most rental units are owned by larger networks, as shown in the graph below.\nOnly 3.1% of networks own more than 25 units, but these networks collectively own 59% of the city’s rental inventory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlargest networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 15 largest ownership networks, by total units\n\n\nCity of Milwaukee\n\n\nowner network1\nnames in network\nunits\nparcels\nassessed value\nannual rates per 100 units\n\n\neviction filings\ncode violations\n\n\n\n\nBERRADA PROPERTIES 106 LLC Group\n122\n9,153\n869\n$409.6M\n32.2\n17.5\n\n\nCITY OF MILWAUKEE Group\n19\n4,402\n868\n$12.1M\n2.5\n1.4\n\n\n1126 KANE LLC Group\n108\n3,665\n179\n$300.4M\n3.6\n3.4\n\n\nMETROPOLITAN ASSOCIATES FKA Group\n10\n2,299\n24\n$144.4M\n8.0\n1.7\n\n\nTCR MRC PHASE I LTD PTNRSHP Group\n16\n2,168\n19\n$338.3M\n0.4\n0.3\n\n\nWI ARBOR RIDGE ON 107TH LLC Group\n8\n1,615\n14\n$243.8M\n2.4\n0.9\n\n\nMLK INVESTMENT GROUP LLC Group\n21\n1,187\n37\n$164.1M\n0.9\n8.5\n\n\nHIGGINS INVESTMENTS LLC Group\n30\n1,135\n49\n$81.5M\n0.6\n3.0\n\n\nWELLSTON APARTMENTS LLC Group\n18\n995\n24\n$108.4M\n0.4\n1.9\n\n\nECT 64 LLC ET AL Group\n24\n974\n24\n$81.2M\n0.4\n3.0\n\n\nICRC HOUSING PROJECT NO 2 Group\n28\n826\n66\n$58.5M\n3.0\n5.7\n\n\nTE I LLC Group\n20\n804\n328\n$46.7M\n36.5\n25.1\n\n\nVB ONE LLC Group\n13\n772\n744\n$79.1M\n21.9\n32.4\n\n\nNORTHSIDE HOMEOWNERS Group\n20\n688\n317\n$29.0M\n29.7\n7.9\n\n\nMIMG XL HARBOR POINTE LLC Group\n2\n596\n5\n$31.2M\n13.6\n3.9\n\n\n\n1 Owner networks are given the name of the most frequently used individual owner name in the network.

    "text": "Code violation data comes from the Milwaukee Department of Neighborhood Services. A code violation can cover a wide range of issues, from minor garbage violations to more serious structural issues. At this time our website simply shows the total number (and rate) of violations, so we encourage readers to use the DNS website to look up specific code violations for properties of interest.\nDNS inspectors are not allowed to enter properties to conduct random inspections. Instead, they usually conduct interior inspections after receiving tenant complaints. Eviction orders correspond to a single visit, and each order can (and often does) include multiple violations requiring specific abatement.\nOur records currently cover 2017-01-01 to 2023-12-31.\n\ncode violation rate calculations\nHere is how we calculate code enforcement rates for each ownership network.\n\nFor each property, we count the number of days during which the current owner held the property and DNS records are available. We determine when the period of current ownership began using the CONVEY_DATE variable provided by the city assessor.\nWe divide the days of ownership (during the DNS-covered period) by 365.25, then multiply by the number of housing units at the property. The product is the number of housing-unit-years.\nWe add up all the housing-unit-years for each property in the network to calculate the network’s total housing-unit-years.\nWe assign code violations to a property’s current owner if the eviction was filed after the current owner bought the property, judging by the CONVEY_DATE field.\nFor each owner network, we count the total number of violations (and orders) and divide by the total number of housing-unit-years. Then, we multiply the quotient by 100. The result is the network’s annual rate of code violations (or orders) per 100 units.\n\n\n\ncitywide rates\nTo calculate citywide rates, we limit the numerator to just code violations occuring at rental properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnual DNS code enforcement totals in the City of Milwaukee\n\n\n\nat rental properties\nrental units1\nper 100 units\n\n\nviolations\norders\nviolations\norders\n\n\n\n\n2017\n53,451\n12,127\n146,548\n36.5\n8.3\n\n\n2018\n48,807\n12,399\n148,023\n33.0\n8.4\n\n\n2019\n48,531\n13,062\n149,027\n32.6\n8.8\n\n\n2020\n34,749\n9,742\n148,720\n23.4\n6.6\n\n\n2021\n40,161\n11,661\n147,730\n27.2\n7.9\n\n\n2022\n35,514\n10,582\n147,403\n24.1\n7.2\n\n\n2023\n38,970\n12,424\n147,196\n26.5\n8.4\n\n\n\n1 Calculated from city parcel records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\naldermanic rates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnual DNS code enforcement totals in the City of Milwaukee\n\n\nby Aldermanic district\n\n\n\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n20211\n20221\n2023\n\n\nviolations\norders\nviolations\norders\nviolations\norders\nviolations\norders\nviolations\norders\nviolations\norders\nviolations\norders\n\n\n\n\nfirst\n62.2\n11.7\n46.1\n9.4\n51.0\n11.4\n36.5\n8.5\n47.1\n10.5\n30.3\n7.7\n32.7\n9.3\n\n\nsecond\n19.0\n6.2\n22.2\n7.8\n22.6\n7.0\n21.6\n6.7\n26.9\n10.2\n28.1\n9.1\n25.3\n9.0\n\n\nthird\n12.9\n4.0\n6.7\n2.7\n9.4\n4.5\n5.0\n2.5\n7.8\n3.4\n7.8\n3.6\n8.3\n4.3\n\n\nfourth\n12.1\n3.1\n11.2\n2.9\n12.2\n3.7\n7.0\n2.3\n7.7\n2.6\n9.5\n3.4\n7.4\n3.4\n\n\nfifth\n13.4\n4.9\n22.3\n10.2\n11.3\n4.5\n14.5\n6.6\n22.4\n9.5\n22.6\n8.8\n25.1\n11.2\n\n\nsixth\n94.8\n13.4\n78.7\n12.0\n62.9\n10.9\n44.1\n8.8\n54.1\n10.6\n41.4\n9.0\n52.0\n12.1\n\n\nseventh\n57.3\n11.1\n50.5\n9.7\n60.5\n12.0\n47.6\n10.4\n50.1\n12.4\n46.1\n11.3\n52.4\n12.6\n\n\neighth\n35.2\n10.8\n33.3\n10.1\n41.3\n14.8\n21.9\n8.9\n32.8\n11.3\n30.9\n9.4\n39.0\n12.1\n\n\nninth\n14.9\n4.9\n11.5\n4.2\n11.7\n3.7\n10.4\n4.3\n10.0\n3.9\n13.7\n4.5\n14.0\n4.8\n\n\ntenth\n32.6\n8.6\n35.1\n10.1\n37.0\n11.6\n26.9\n7.2\n28.9\n10.1\n31.4\n10.7\n25.2\n9.4\n\n\neleventh\n15.4\n5.8\n27.5\n10.6\n21.4\n7.4\n23.3\n7.6\n20.2\n9.0\n17.9\n7.8\n20.0\n9.5\n\n\ntwelfth\n48.2\n12.7\n45.8\n13.0\n50.3\n17.5\n26.8\n9.8\n28.0\n9.2\n22.9\n7.3\n30.3\n10.0\n\n\nthirteenth\n14.7\n5.6\n21.8\n9.4\n21.5\n8.3\n23.7\n7.9\n20.1\n8.3\n14.6\n6.0\n19.5\n9.0\n\n\nfourteenth\n27.2\n12.3\n25.1\n10.9\n17.1\n6.4\n13.3\n5.5\n16.5\n6.4\n12.1\n5.1\n17.0\n7.5\n\n\nfifteenth\n77.0\n13.2\n64.2\n12.3\n66.4\n13.3\n45.2\n8.9\n52.0\n10.8\n47.3\n10.9\n49.2\n11.6\n\n\n\n1 Various pandemic-era policy interventions, including moratoriums, reduced evictions during these years"

    "text": "Census data also measures housing units and tenure, providing a useful external check on our measurements.\nThe 2020 decennial census counted 257,700 total housing units in the city, of which 92,900 were owner-occupied and 154,500 were rented or listed for rent. (The remainder were unoccupied, but not for rent).\nThe 2022 1-year American Community Survey (ACS) estimated a total of 261,200 housing units with a margin of error of about 3,800. Of those, the ACS estimated that 96,000 were owner-occupied (MOE of 4,300) and 147,600 were rentals (MOE of 4,800).\nWe measure the owner-occupation of a parcel by comparing the address to which the property taxes are mailed with the situs address(es) of the property. If they match and the property is coded as a non-apartment building, we consider it owner-occupied. Our measure closely matches census estimates of total owner-occupied housing units, as the graph below shoes.\n\nWe identify residential housing units using the city assessor’s residential housing units field and removing parcels which are owner occupied. This means we consider duplexes owner-occupied when the owner lives at the property, regardless of whether or not they rent out their additional unit. This situation also affects a small number of owner-occupied triplexes and quadplexes.\nFor these reasons, we expect our count of rental units to slightly undercount rental units relative to the true total. Currently, we count 148,177 rental units, compared to 154,500 in the 2020 census count and 147,600 in the 2022 ACS estimate. Considering the different methods for generating these statistics, we are satisfied with this general agreement across data sources."
